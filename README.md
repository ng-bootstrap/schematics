# @ng-bootstrap/schematics

Scaffolding library for Angular applications using NgBootstrap

@ng-bootstrap/schematics provides CLI commands to initially add NgBootstrap to an existing application. This tool integrates with [`Angular CLI`](https://cli.angular.io/), and is built on top of [`Schematics`](https://blog.angular.io/schematics-an-introduction-dc1dfbc2a2b2).

## Usage

Starting from an exiting Angular CLI scaffolded application, simply execute this command:

```bash
cd my-app
ng add @ng-bootstrap/schematics
```

Your app has now been ng-bootstrapped !
